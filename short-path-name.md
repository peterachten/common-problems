# Unable to get short path name

Keywords: short path name

On Windows, compilation of any program may fail when Clean is installed in a
directory with a long absolute path to the root of the disk
(e.g., `C:\Documents and Settings\Administrator\My Documents\University\2017-2018\Functional Programming\Course programs\Clean 2.4`).
It can be fixed quite easily by moving the Clean installation directory to a
directory closer to the root of the disk.

## Solutions

- Move the Clean installation to a directory with a shorter path to the root of
  the disk (e.g., `C:\Clean`).
